      <h1> About Me </h1>
      <p> My name is Peter Majdalani, I am currently a freshman at the University of Rhode Island and I major in Computer Science. I was born in Providence, Rhode Island and was raised in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.
       I graduated high school in 2021 at William E. Tolman High School. I hope in the future I'll have a job in software development or cyber security. </p>
